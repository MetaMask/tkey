tKey is the underlying SDK used to implement [Web3Auth Plug n Play](https://github.com/web3auth/web3auth). This package can also be used to self host Web3Auth in your own system. tKey stands for Threshold Key, which refers to the management keys & shares generated using threshold cryptography.

> **v16 Breaking Change:** All cryptographic primitives have been migrated from `bn.js`/`elliptic`/`Buffer` to native `bigint`/`@noble/curves`/`Uint8Array`. See the [Migration Guide](#migration-guide) below.

## The `tKey` SDK

The `tKey` SDK manages private keys by generating shares of it using Shamir Secret Sharing. For example, for a 2 out of 3 (2/3) setup, we give the
user three shares: ShareA, ShareB, and ShareC.

- **ShareA** is stored on the user’s device: Implementation is device and system specific. For example, on mobile devices, the share could be stored
  in device storage secured via biometrics.
- **ShareB** is managed and split across Web3Auth's Auth Network, accessed by an OAuth login provider that a user owns.
- **ShareC** is a recovery share: An extra share to be kept by the user, possibly kept on a separate device, downloaded or based on user input with
  enough entropy (eg. password, security questions, hardware device etc.).

Similar to existing 2FA systems, a user needs to prove ownership of at least 2 out of 3 (2/3) shares, in order to retrieve his private key.

## Migration Guide

### v16: `bigint` / `@noble/curves` / `Uint8Array`

v16 removes all legacy cryptography dependencies in favor of modern, audited alternatives:

| Before                    | After                     |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `bn.js` (`BN`)            | Native `bigint`           |
| `elliptic`                | `@noble/curves/secp256k1` |
| `@toruslabs/tweetnacl-js` | `@noble/curves/ed25519`   |
| `Buffer`                  | `Uint8Array`              |

**What you need to change:**

- **Private keys and share values** are now `bigint` instead of `BN`. Replace `new BN(hex, 16)` with `BigInt(\`0x${hex}\`)`.
- **Public keys and encrypted data** are now `Uint8Array` instead of `Buffer`. Use `hexToBytes` / `bytesToHex` from `@toruslabs/metadata-helpers` for conversions.
- **`BNString` type** has been renamed to **`BigIntString`** and is `bigint | string` (was `BN | string`).
- **JSON serialization** of objects containing `bigint` requires the `bigIntReplacer` from `@tkey/common-types`:
  ```js
  import { bigIntReplacer } from "@tkey/common-types";
  JSON.stringify(thresholdKey, bigIntReplacer);
  ```
- **`@tkey/tss`** has been removed from this package and will be migrated separately.

## Building the SDK Locally

### Requirements

- This package requires a peer dependency of `@babel/runtime`
- Node 22+

### Installation

```
npm install
npm run pack:lerna
```

## Bundling

Each sub package is distributed in 3 formats

- `esm` build `dist/<MODULE_NAME>.esm.js` in es6 format
- `commonjs` build `dist/<MODULE_NAME>.cjs.js` in es5 format
- `umd` build `dist/<MODULE_NAME>.umd.min.js` in es5 format without polyfilling corejs minified

By default, the appropriate format is used for your specified usecase
You can use a different format (if you know what you're doing) by referencing the correct file

The cjs build is not polyfilled with core-js.
It is upto the user to polyfill based on the browserlist they target

### Directly in Browser

CDN's serve the non-core-js polyfilled version by default. You can use a different

jsdeliver

```js
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/<MODULE_NAME>"></script>
```

unpkg

```js
<script src="https://unpkg.com/<MODULE_NAME>"></script>
```

### Tips for NUXT

This is a plugin that works [only on the client side](https://nuxtjs.org/guide/plugins/#client-side-only). So please register it as a ssr-free plugin.
